	abstract = {Bacteriophages (henceforth phages) evolve by mutation and recombination. Temperate phages are known to evolve rapidly by genetic exchanges. In contrast, recombination events between virulent and between temperate and virulent phages have rarely been reported. A gene flow barrier between these two large distinct groups of phages could affect the ability of phages to acquire novel functions. Here, we show that genomes of temperate and virulent phages are very distinct but often have a few almost identical genes. These cases are due to recent genetic exchanges of both phage-like and bacterial-like genes. These exchanges were probably mediated by phage recombinases with low homology requirements and mechanisms of non-homologous end joining, since both were over-represented in recombinant phages and their hosts. When assessing the impact of gene flow across the two populations of phages we realized that temperate phages have narrower host ranges than virulent phages. This suggests, and we find some evidence, that gene flow between temperate phages infecting distant bacterial hosts might be mediated by recombination with the broader host virulent phages. Hence, gene flow across phages with distinct lifestyles could drastically increase the gene repertoire available for phage evolution, including the transfer of functional innovations across taxa. These results also have implications for bacterial evolution because of the impact of phage predation in bacterial population dynamics and the contribution of temperate phages to the evolution of bacterial gene repertoires.},

Their genetic diversity is considerable, and there are 28 distinct genomic types (clusters) with related nucleotide sequences. However, amino acid sequence comparisons show pervasive genomic mosaicism, and quantification of inter-cluster and intra-cluster relatedness reveals a continuum of genetic diversity, albeit with uneven representation of different phages. Furthermore, rarefaction analysis shows that the mycobacteriophage population is not closed, and there is a constant influx of genes from other sources.

These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7–38\% of ‘unknown’ sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus–host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes.},

	abstract = {Bacterial viruses, i.e., ‘bacteriophage’ or ‘phage’, can infect and lyse their bacterial hosts, releasing new viral progeny. In addition to the lytic pathway, certain bacteriophage (i.e., ‘temperate’ bacteriophage) can also initiate lysogeny, a latent mode of infection in which the viral genome is integrated into and replicated with the bacterial chromosome. Subsequently, the integrated viral genome, i.e., the ‘prophage’, can induce and restart the lytic pathway. Here, we explore the relationship between infection mode, ecological context, and viral fitness, in essence asking: when should viruses be temperate? To do so, we use network loop analysis to quantify fitness in terms of network paths through the life history of an infectious pathogen that start and end with infected cells. This analysis reveals that temperate strategies, particularly those with direct benefits to cellular fitness, should be favored at low host abundances. This finding applies to a spectrum of mechanistic models of phage-bacteria dynamics spanning both explicit and implicit representations of intracellular infection dynamics. However, the same analysis reveals that temperate strategies, in and of themselves, do not provide an advantage when infection imposes a cost to cellular fitness. Hence, we use evolutionary invasion analysis to explore when temperate phage can invade microbial communities with circulating lytic phage. We find that lytic phage can drive down niche competition amongst microbial cells, facilitating the subsequent invasion of latent strategies that increase cellular resistance and/or immunity to infection by lytic viruses – notably this finding holds even when the prophage comes at a direct fitness cost to cellular reproduction. Altogether, our analysis identifies broad ecological conditions that favor latency and provide a principled framework for exploring the impacts of ecological context on both the short- and long-term benefits of being temperate.},

The new genomes belong to dozens of established and emerging viral families. Some appear to be the result of previously undescribed recombination events between ssDNA and ssRNA viruses. In addition, hundreds of circular DNA elements that do not encode any discernable similarities to previously characterized sequences were identified. To characterize these ‘dark matter’ sequences, we used an artificial neural network to identify candidate viral capsid proteins, several of which formed virus-like particles when expressed in culture.

Prophages are largely quiescent, but they can alter host phenotype through factors encoded in their genomes (often virulence factors) or by disrupting host genes as a result of integration. Here we describe another mechanism by which a prophage can modulate host phenotype. We show that a temperate phage that integrates in Escherichia coli reprograms host regulation of an anaerobic respiratory system, thereby inhibiting a bet hedging strategy. The phage exerts this effect by upregulating a host-encoded signal transduction protein through transcription initiated from a phage-encoded promoter. We further show that this phenomenon occurs not only in a laboratory strain of E. coli, but also in a natural isolate that contains a prophage at this site.},

	abstract = {Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors ϳ30 to 50\% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-ampliﬁed) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire ﬁeld site in northern Sweden. Only 15\% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and ϳ30\% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-viruslike assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identiﬁed and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact hostmediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics has revealed the existence of numerous uncharacterized viral lineages, which are referred to as viral “dark matter.” However, our knowledge regarding viral genomes is biased toward culturable viruses. In this study, we analyzed 1,600 (1,352 nonredundant) complete double-stranded DNA viral genomes (10 to 211 kb) assembled from 52 marine viromes. Together with 244 previously reported uncultured viral genomes, a genome-wide comparison delineated 617 genuslevel operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for these environmental viral genomes (EVGs). Of these, 600 OTUs contained no representatives from known viruses, thus putatively corresponding to novel viral genera. Predicted hosts of the EVGs included major groups of marine prokaryotes, such as marine group II Euryarchaeota and SAR86, from which no viruses have been isolated to date, as well as Flavobacteriaceae and SAR116. Our analysis indicates that marine cyanophages are already well represented in genome databases and that one of the EVGs likely represents a new cyanophage lineage. Several EVGs encode many enzymes that appear to function for an efﬁcient utilization of iron-sulfur clusters or to enhance host survival. This suggests that there is a selection pressure on these marine viruses to accumulate genes for speciﬁc viral propagation strategies. Finally, we revealed that EVGs contribute to a 4-fold increase in the recruitment of photic-zone viromes compared with the use of current reference viral genomes.},

	abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

	abstract = {Rapid turnover of mobile elements drives the plasticity of bacterial genomes. Integrated bacteriophages (prophages) encode host-adaptive traits and represent a sizable fraction of bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that natural selection shapes prophage integration patterns relative to the host genome organization. We tested this idea by detecting and studying 500 prophages of 69 strains of Escherichia and Salmonella. Phage integrases often target not only conserved genes but also intergenic positions, suggesting purifying selection for integration sites. Furthermore, most integration hotspots are conserved between the two host genera. Integration sites seem also selected at the large chromosomal scale, as they are nonrandomly organized in terms of the origin–terminus axis and the macrodomain structure. The genes of lambdoid prophages are systematically co-oriented with the bacterial replication fork and display the host high frequency of polarized FtsK-orienting polar sequences motifs required for chromosome segregation. matS motifs are strongly avoided by prophages suggesting counter selection of motifs disrupting macrodomains. These results show how natural selection for seamless integration of prophages in the chromosome shapes the evolution of the bacterium and the phage. First, integration sites are highly conserved for many millions of years favoring lysogeny over the lytic cycle for temperate phages. Second, the global distribution of prophages is intimately associated with the chromosome structure and the patterns of gene expression. Third, the phage endures selection for DNA motifs that pertain exclusively to the biology of the prophage in the bacterial chromosome. Understanding prophage genetic adaptation sheds new lights on the coexistence of horizontal transfer and organized bacterial genomes.},

By synthesizing circularized phage genomes from prophages embedded in diverse enteric bacteria, we produced gokushoviruses in an experimentally tractable model system, allowing us to investigate their features and biology. We demonstrate that virions can reliably infect and lysogenize hosts by hijacking a conserved chromosome-dimer resolution system. Sequence motifs required for lysogeny are detectable in other metagenomically defined gokushoviruses; however, we show that even partial motifs enable phages to persist cytoplasmically without leading to collapse of their host culture. This ability to employ multiple, disparate survival strategies is likely key to the long-term persistence and global distribution of Gokushovirinae.},
